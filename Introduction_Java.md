# History

**Java** is a widely-used, versatile, and
platform-independent programming language known for its
simplicity, robustness, and scalability. Developed by James
Gosling and his team at Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle
Corporation) in the mid-1990s, Java has since become one of
the most popular languages in the world, powering everything
from enterprise software to mobile applications, web
development, and embedded systems.Java was created because
back in the 1990s, making software was tough. There were
many different types of computers, and each ran on different
systems, making it hard to write programs that worked
everywhere.

# Speciality

1. **Platform independence :** When a programmer writes Java
   code, they save it in a file with a ".java" extension.
   Then, they use a Java compiler (like javac) to translate t
   this human-readable code into bytecode.
   <span style="color:red;"> Bytecode is a special kind of code that's not
   tied to any specific computer or operating system.</span>
   Instead of generating machine code specific to a
   particular system, the Java compiler produces bytecode, which is a set of instructions    <span style="color:red;">understood by the
   Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This bytecode is platform-independent, meaning it can run on any device that has a
   JVM installed. </span>   To run the Java program, you need a JVM installed on the target device. The JVM is responsible for
   interpreting the bytecode and translating it into machine code that the specific hardware and operating system can
   understand. For instance, you can run your HelloWorld.class file on a Windows computer, a Mac, or a Linux machine,
   as long as they have a JVM installed.    <span style="color:red;"> The JVM takes care of executing the bytecode in a
   way that's suitable for the
   particular system it's running on. </span>

public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
