# History

**Java** is a widely-used, versatile, and platform-independent programming language known for its simplicity, robustness, and scalability. Developed by James Gosling and his team at Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle Corporation) in the mid-1990s, Java has since become one of the most popular languages in the world, powering everything from enterprise software to mobile applications, web development, and embedded systems.Java was created because back in the 1990s, making software was tough. There were many different types of computers, and each ran on different systems, making it hard to write programs that worked everywhere.

# Speciality

1. ### Platform Independence :
   When a programmer writes Java
   code, they save it in a file with a ".java" extension.
   Then, they use a Java compiler (like javac) to translate t
   this human-readable code into bytecode.
   <span style="color:red;"> Bytecode is a special kind of code that's not
   tied to any specific computer or operating system.</span>
   Instead of generating machine code specific to a
   particular system, the Java compiler produces bytecode, which is a set of instructions    <span style="color:red;">understood by the
   Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This bytecode is platform-independent, meaning it can run on any device that has a
   JVM installed. </span>   To run the Java program, you need a JVM installed on the target device. The JVM is responsible for
   interpreting the bytecode and translating it into machine code that the specific hardware and operating system can
   understand. For instance, you can run your HelloWorld.class file on a Windows computer, a Mac, or a Linux machine,
   as long as they have a JVM installed.    <span style="color:red;"> The JVM takes care of executing the bytecode in a
   way that's suitable for the
   particular system it's running on. </span>

2. ### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) :
   Java is a pure object-oriented programming language, emphasizing the creation of reusable code components called objects. OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism allow for modular and maintainable code.

3. ### Security :
   Suppose you download a Java program from the internet that claims to be a game. Before running the program, Java performs bytecode verification, which checks the program for any potentially harmful code or security vulnerabilities. If the program passes this verification process, Java then runs it within a secure environment called the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
   Now, let's say this program attempts to access your personal files without your permission. Java's security manager steps in and prevents the program from doing so, ensuring that it can only access resources it's allowed to access. This protects your personal data from unauthorized access or malicious actions by the program.
4. ### Multi-threading Support :
   In Java, multi-threading allows programs to do multiple tasks simultaneously. It's like having multiple workers in a factory, each working on a different task at the same time. This helps programs run faster and more efficiently, especially when dealing with tasks that can be done independently.
   Example: Imagine you're writing a Java program to download files from the internet. Instead of downloading one file at a time, you can use multi-threading to download multiple files simultaneously. This means while one thread is downloading one file, another thread can be downloading a different file at the same time. As a result, your program can download files much faster, improving overall performance and user experience.
5. ### Robustness & Reliability : 
   Java is very good at catching mistakes and making sure programs run smoothly. It's like having a safety net while walking on a tightrope. Even if you make a small mistake, Java helps prevent your program from crashing or causing problems. It also cleans up after itself, so you don't have to worry about leaving behind a mess.
   Example: Imagine you're building a program that adds two numbers together. In Java, if you accidentally try to add a number to a string (like trying to add "5" + 3), Java will notice this mistake and stop your program from crashing. Instead, it will handle the situation gracefully and let you know there's an issue, so you can fix it before it causes any trouble. This kind of safety feature helps ensure your programs run reliably and without unexpected errors. In short it provides runtime error, exception handling etc.
6. ### Scalability : 
   In Java, scalability refers to the ability of a program to handle more work as the demand increases, without sacrificing performance or reliability. It's like adding more lanes to a highway to accommodate more traffic without causing congestion.
   Example: Let's say you have a Java web application that allows users to search for products in an online store. As the number of users increases, the application needs to handle more search requests without slowing down or crashing. With Java's scalability, you can easily add more servers or resources to your application to handle the increased workload, ensuring that it remains responsive and reliable even under heavy traffic
7. ### Rich Standard Library :
   Java comes with lots of ready-to-use tools for various tasks, like building websites or handling data. It's like having a big toolbox filled with all the tools you need to build different things. These tools save time and effort because you don't have to create them from scratch.
   Example: Suppose you want to read data from a file in Java. Instead of writing code to open the file, read its contents, and handle any errors that may occur, you can simply use Java's built-in classes from the standard library. For example, you can use the FileReader and BufferedReader classes to easily read data from a file without having to write a lot of code yourself. This saves you time and makes your code more efficient.
8. ### Strong Community : 
   Java has a strong community around the world. There are many developers, lead position engineers etc. It is very much easy to get help when someone stuck with java developing


# JVM
Think of the JVM as a special "virtual computer" that understands and runs Java programs. It's like having a translator that takes Java code(which humans write) and turns it into instructions that a real computer can understand and execute.The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) was developed by Sun Microsystems, which was later acquired by Oracle Corporation in 2010. Sun Microsystems introduced the concept of the JVM as part of the Java platform, which was designed to provide a runtime environment for executing Java programs across different hardware and operating systems.
The JVM was first released in 1996 along with the initial release of the Java Development Kit (JDK). Over the years, the JVM has undergone numerous enhancements and optimizations to improve performance, security, and compatibility with evolving hardware and software environments.
Today, Oracle continues to develop and maintain the JVM as part of its Java platform offerings. Additionally, there are alternative JVM implementations, such as OpenJ9 and GraalVM, which are developed by other organizations and communities. These implementations aim to provide alternative runtime environments for executing Java programs with different performance characteristics and features.
